# Challenge18-Social-Network-API

## Description

This week were challenged to create a backend application for a social networking web platform. The API was constructed using Express.js and MongoDB, using Mongoose ODM to manage relationships between data. The API created lets users share their thoughts, react to others thoughts, and manage a friends list. The app conforms to the needs of social media startups that require scalable solutions for dealing large amounts of unstructured data.

## Installation 

-git clone the repository to your local machine
-npm install dependecies
-make sure MongoDB is running
-npm start will run the application

## Usage

-npm run seed to seed datebase
-npm start to run the server
-connect to MongoDB server
